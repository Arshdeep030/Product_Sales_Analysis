## Reporting & Techniques Used

| # | Question |
|--|---------|
| 30 | The **Customer Report** provides insights into customer demographics, sales behavior, and spending segmentation. |
| 31 | The **Product Report** highlights key product performance indicators such as sales, quantity, recency, and average revenue per month. |
| 32 | Using window functions (e.g., `RANK()`, `LAG()`, `AVG() OVER`) gives deeper insights into comparative and temporal analytics. |
| 33 | Conditional segmentation (`CASE WHEN`) is effectively used for classifying customers and products into meaningful categories. |
| 34 | The structure of using CTEs (Common Table Expressions) before aggregation improves readability and maintainability of complex queries. |
